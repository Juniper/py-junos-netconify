## ABOUT

Junos console/bootstrap New-Out-Of-Box (NOOB) configuration automation. 

There are times when you MUST console into a Junos device to perform the NOOB configuration.  Generally this configuration is the bare minimum in takes to:

  * set the root password
  * set the host-name
  * set the management ipaddr
  * enable ssh and optionally NETCONF

The general use-case:

Primarily this library is used as a Console driver for the Junos Ansible Modules.

The `netconify` utility can be used perform configuration by logging into the serial console and pushing a configuration file to the device.

                 [--qfx-switch] [--zeroize] [--shutdown {poweroff,reboot}]
                 [--facts] [--srx_cluster REQUEST_SRX_CLUSTER]
                 [--srx_cluster_disable] [-S [SAVEDIR]] [--no-save] [-p PORT]
                 [-b BAUD] [-t TELNET] [--timeout TIMEOUT] [-u USER]

  --srx_cluster REQUEST_SRX_CLUSTER
                        cluster_id,node ... Invoke cluster on SRX device and
                        reboot
  --srx_cluster_disable
                        Disable cluster mode on SRX device and reboot

DIRECTORY options:
  -S [SAVEDIR], --savedir [SAVEDIR]
                        Files are saved into this directory, $CWD by default
  --no-save             Do not save facts and inventory files

                        terminal server, <host>,<port>
  --timeout TIMEOUT     TTY connection timeout (s)

LOGIN options:
  -u USER, --user USER  login user name, defaults to "root"
  -P PASSWD, --passwd PASSWD
                        login user password, *empty* for NOOB
  -k                    prompt for user password
  -a ATTEMPTS, --attempts ATTEMPTS
                        login attempts before giving up

## EXAMPLE

Junos NOOB devices can netconified:

````
[rsherman@py-junos-netconify bin]$ ./netconify --telnet=host,23 -f host.conf
TTY:login:connecting to TTY:host:23 ...
TTY:login:logging in ...
TTY:login:starting NETCONF
conf:loading into device ...
conf:commit ... please be patient
conf:commit completed.
TTY:logout:logging out ...
````

The above example is connecting to the host via telnet on port 23 and loading the configuration file specified.  Additonal options such as serial connectivity, fact gathering, and device specific functions are identified in Usage.
